			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>How might we as designers think about and work toward a sustainable and just world in ways that don’t recreate or embody the capitalist and colonialist ideologies that ultimately result in the problems that we are trying to solve?</p><br>
				
				<p>Present Future is a four-part auditory digital remix of future-thinking narratives in the context of climate, built environments, and resistance—rooted in <a href="files/Indigenous Worldviews.pdf" target="_blank">indigenous worldviews</a> and the powerful work and leadership of frontline communities. It aims to position the viewer within the larger climate justice movement and think critically about engaging in a decolonized future through methodologies that are embodied, collective, holistic, place-based and generative.</p><br>

			<div class="float-left text-chapter">
				<h5 class="ch1">Chapter One</h5>
				<h2 class="ch1">Business as Usual</h2>
				<p>What is the logic of innovation? In an age of development and rapid advancement of technology, what do the different realms of lived realities look like? Globally, poor and indigenous communities, the ones least responsible for climate change, are not only bracing the brunt of the ramifications, but are also targeted and exploited for their land, knowledge, and labor. Chapter One offers provocations around the cost of innovation, who the future belongs to, and what homogenous short-term developments mean for frontline communities and the natural environment.</p><br>
				
				<p>The voices in this remix include <em>Julia Watson</em>, a designer, activist, academic, and author of “Lo-TEK, Design by Radical Indigenism,” and leading expert in the field of Lo-TEK nature-based technologies for the built environment and climate-resilient design, <em>Nick Tilsen</em>, a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation and President of NDN Collective—an organization devoted to building Indigenous power, as well as activists and organizers from <em>Climate Justice Alliance</em>, architects <em>Vishaan Chakrabarti</em>,  <em>Jeff Sharpe</em>, and <em>Thomas Bryans</em>, U.S. Representative <em>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</em>, and author <em>Arundhati Roy</em>. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="float-left text-chapter">
				<h5 class="ch2">Chapter Two</h5>
				<h2 class="ch2">Indigenous</h2>
				<p>The complexities and sophistication of indigenous worldviews are commonly rooted in a deep respect and mindfulness of the need for a reciprocal relationship with the land. Chapter Two begins by introducing Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and the ways that Indigenous people have been at the forefront of protecting biodiversity and developing resilient technologies that are sustainable and symbiotic, while simultaneously  bearing the brunt of colonization and structural violence. The resistance at Maunakea, where land continues to be stolen and desecrated, depicts the ongoing struggle for the rights and sovereignty of Indigenous peoples. Climate justice includes the liberation of Indigenous peoples globally.</p><br>
				
				<p>The voices in this remix include <em>Julia Watson</em>, <em>Nick Tilsen</em>, <em>Jefa Greenaway</em>, a Wailwan and Kamilaroi man and architect committed to an Indigenous and holistic approach to designing places and spaces, and activists from Maunakea, including <em>Hawane Rios</em>, <em>Kaho'okahi Kanuha</em>, and <em>Pualani Case</em>.</p>

				<h5>“Healing of land must include healing of people and vice versa. Recognizing and processing the emotional traumas held in our bodies as descendants of assaulted, enslaved, and displaced peoples is necessary to the healing of land. Returning our rights to care for, harvest from, and relate to the land that birthed us is part of this recognition.”</h5><br>

			<div class="float-left text-chapter">
				<h5 class="ch3">Chapter Three</h5>
				<h2 class="ch3">Within</h2>
				<p>How might we understand ourselves in relation to a decolonized and just future? What does that look like? Chapter Three aims to facilitate an internalizing of the previous chapter in thinking about our own relationship with our environment, our community, and ourselves. This chapter narrates a conversation with activists, leaders, and designers, that understands solutions as a product of local, community based initiatives that require an embodiment of healing, envisioning, and practicing.</p><br>
				
				<p>The voices and narrations in this remix include <em>Nick Tilsen</em>, <em>Jefa Greenaway</em>, activists and organizers from <em>Climate Justice Alliance</em>, <em>Kia Dowell</em>, a Gija woman from Warmun Community in Western Australia, and <em>Adrienne Maree Brown</em>, an American author and activist.</p>

				<h5 class="ch4">Chapter Four</h5>
				<h2 class="ch4">The Frontline </h2>
				<p>The last chapter of this series is a celebration and call to action. It aims to narrate the embodied practices of collectivity, organizing, and the ways that frontline communities have been at the forefront of the climate justice movement; not only envisioning a just future, but of leading and building towards that. It’s not just about knowing or acknowledging the history and struggle, but about actively engaging in the work within ourselves and in our communities. The fight for climate justice is a fight for Indigenous sovereignty and rights, for healthy and safe communities, and for an active decolonization of institutions. </p><br>
				
				<p>Chapter Four brings together the victories and demands of frontline communities in the climate justice movement, from the <em>Poor Peoples’ Campaign</em>, the <em>Climate Justice Alliance</em>, and <em>NDN Collective</em>. The narrative ends by returning to Moanakea with the song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbMX_LoT_YA"  target="_blank">Kū Haʻaheo E Kuʻu Hawaiʻi</a>," which was recorded by over three dozen of Hawai'i's celebrated musical artists. The song calls for the people of Hawai'i to stand united against colonizers, and ends with saying, "paddle on in our pursuit of civil justice, until our dignity and independence is restored."</p>
